# Interpolation-Approximation
This Python-based project focuses on the implementation of polynimoial interpolation by lagrange to approximate function to data points and estimate values between known data points.

# Features:
Utilize mathematical theory of Lagrange Interpolation Approximiation.
Implement the  Lagrange Interpolation by equal distance points.
Implement the  Lagrange Interpolation by Chebichev points.
Comparing the approximations that differ only at the points of division.

# File:
Python code, the input - The function and the edges of the segment in which it is defined, the degree of the approximation polynomial.
